Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Your IntStack didn't compile, due to a missing final closing curly brace.  I
fixed that for you and all is well.

There was no Queue testing included, and your main in that file is empty, so
I put a copy of my test harness in your directory, modified to match the name
of your display() method and it seems to work fine up to the last when there
is a "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" thrown.  Probably some mis-match in
your code and mine, but check it out to be sure.  You earned 1/2 credit for
each of those items.

Deque runs fine.

It would be helpful to provide the user with more output as to what is going
on with the program.  Your CircLinkedList runs, but it's a little hard to
tell what operations are being tested without looking at the code.

IntStack, once compiled, throws a "" right off.  Again, without more output
to see what's happeneing, it's hard to determine at what point this is
occurring.  Good thing that's only one point!

Nice work on Josephus!

When you copy code from the textbook, you should re-format it so that it has
proper indenting.  I know it's kind of a PITA, but the upside is you get to
read through the code and learn what it's doing, to familiarize yourself.
This is an invaluable skill when you are MODIFYING someone else's code, and
that is a job to which many entry-level software developers are assigned.

Otherwise, very nice work on this assignment, you two!  You seem to be a
good team!  Keep up the good work...........
