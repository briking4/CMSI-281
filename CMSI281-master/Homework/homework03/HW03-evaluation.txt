Homework03 Evaluation
======================
You MUST do problem 1, the "odd-even sort"

You MUST do EITHER problem 2, Huffman, OR problem 3, Simon.
Whichever one you choose is your option, but you must indicate
which one you choose.  If you want to do both of them, you will
be given extra credit for whatever points you get correct on
the second problem.  For example, if you choose to do Simon and
it is completely correct, and you do Huffman for extra credit
and get 5 out of 7 correct, you will get 136% for the assignment.
The extra points will be applied at the end of the semester to
improve your overall score for the course.

Assuming odd-even sort is correct, of course....

Total credit is 14 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
   extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 21 points for all three

You earned:
-----------

you got 20 out of 14 which is 142.86% which is still an A-plus

AWESOME job on this assignment!

Everything works great, except in Simon you aren't erasing the user entry
so it is still displayed at the end of each turn.  Also, you don't display
the entire string each time, only the last additional character.  Still,
though, it works well enough to earn most of the credit.

Your sort routine is flawless.

Huffman does a great job, except when the output is decoded I get an extra
"S" in the output.  You convert it to uppercase, which is fine, but on the
decoded output for my test string "this is" I get back "THISSIS"...  Still,
very very close for that hard problem!

OUTSTANDING WORK!  You two should be very proud!!

Keep it up........   :grin:
